# api/auth

Access control: two accounts, their sessions, and the time-limited free access
codes that let a visitor open one.

There is no user-owned data anywhere in SciTerm — papers, chunks, and entities
are a single global pool. A user here is a key to the expensive doors, not an
owner of anything.

## The invariant

`anonfree` can never hold more live tokens than there are activated access
codes. That is enforced by the schema, not by counting:

* every anonfree session names the code that minted it;
* a partial unique index allows one un-revoked session per code;
* composite foreign keys mirror `users.is_anonymous` and
  `free_access_codes.activated` onto the session row, so row-local CHECKs can
  see them — Postgres cannot put a subquery in a CHECK.

The consequence is one *seat* per code: redeeming a code on a second device
revokes the first session rather than adding one.

## Files

**`models.py`** — `users`, `free_access_codes`, `auth_sessions`, and the
constraints above. Read this first; the comments there are the design.

**`tokens.py`** — a short-lived access-token JWT (verified from its signature,
no per-request database hit) and an opaque refresh token stored only as a
sha256 digest and rotated on every use.

**`service.py`** — redeem, login, refresh, logout, generate. Redemption
activates the code, moves the seat and opens the session in one transaction.
A code's `activation_date` is stamped once and never restamped: restamping
would put the 48-hour deadline permanently out of reach.

**`dependencies.py`** — `require_user` / `require_admin`. Attached at *router*
level in `pb_client`, `pm_client`, `ingestion` and the corpus package's
`protected_router`, so a route added to one of those is gated the day it is
written.

**`routes.py`** — `/auth/*` and `/admin/*`. See "Admin endpoints" below;
they do not use tokens at all.

**`sshsig.py`** — verifies OpenSSH SSHSIG signatures against the public keys
committed in [`api/authorized_keys/`](../authorized_keys). Read the module
docstring before touching it: three checks there are load-bearing and all three
are easy to leave out.

**`throttle.py`** — an in-process sliding-window limiter on `/auth/login`,
`/auth/redeem` and `/admin/challenge`. Login is the one that matters: verifying
a password costs ~200 ms of PBKDF2, paid before the caller has proved anything,
so an unthrottled endpoint is a CPU denial-of-service against the one username
that exists. Login is keyed on both the client address *and* the username — the
username key is what caps the work when attempts arrive from many addresses,
and the address key only means anything when uvicorn runs with
`--proxy-headers`. In-process rather than shared, so it adds no dependency and
no "what if Redis is down" policy; see the module docstring for that trade.

**`passwords.py`** — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. Not scrypt: `hashlib.scrypt` is absent
unless CPython was linked against an OpenSSL that offers it, and it is missing
from the Python in `.venv`.

## What is gated

Reading the corpus is free, so the whole UI loads with real papers for an
anonymous visitor. Gated: `/import`, `/pb`, `/pm`, `/corpus/rag_search` and
`/corpus/{id}/references` — everything that spends the NCBI budget or real
compute.

## Configuration

**`config.py`** — `AuthSettings`: the signing key, token lifetimes and cookie
policy, kept out of `api.app.config` on purpose. The Celery worker imports this
package transitively (the client packages export their routers), so the class
is constructed lazily through `get_auth_settings()`: importing the module must
never demand a secret, only calling it does. The upshot is that the worker runs
with no `JWT_SECRET` at all, and the prod fail-closed check binds the API
alone.

`SCITERM_ENV=local` (the default) switches all of this off and yields a local
admin, so development is exactly as it was before auth existed. `prod` requires
`JWT_SECRET` and refuses to start without one. See `.env.example`.

Issue codes and rotate the admin password with `scripts/admin.sh`.

## Admin endpoints

`/admin/generate_codes` and `/admin/create_admin_user` are **not** token
authenticated. They take an SSH signature over a single-use nonce, made by a
key whose public half is committed to this repository:

```
POST /admin/challenge  {action}            -> {nonce, namespace}
ssh-keygen -Y sign -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -n sciterm-admin <nonce file>
POST /admin/<action>   {nonce, signature, ...}
```

Why not an admin token: `create_admin_user` sets the admin password, so it
cannot require one — that is the bootstrap problem. A committed public key
solves it without putting any secret in the repository, since a public key is
not a secret, and makes rotation a commit. `scripts/admin.sh` does both steps.

`create_admin_user` always rotates. There is no way to call it and leave the
old password working, so a leaked admin password is fixed by calling it again.
An empty `password` has the server generate a 32-character one and return it
once. The username is always `admin`, enforced both in the route and by
`uq_users_single_admin`, a partial unique index permitting one admin row.

Nonces live in `admin_challenges` and are spent with `DELETE ... RETURNING`, so
single use is atomic. The nonce is consumed *before* the signature is checked:
a wrong signature still burns it, which is what stops an attacker grinding
attempts against one long-lived nonce.

## Dependencies

`fastapi`, `PyJWT`, `cryptography` (Ed25519 verification), `SQLAlchemy`, and
`api.db` for the session factory.
