"""Liveness and readiness, split because a load balancer needs the first only.

`/health` answers "is this process serving?" and nothing else. It is what the
ALB target group should poll. Deliberately no database call: if Postgres goes
down, every task fails the check at once, the balancer drains the whole target
group, and visitors get its own 503 instead of the app's error. That turns a
degraded dependency into a total outage and hides the cause.

`/health/ready` answers "can this process do useful work?" and does touch the
dependencies. Use it after a deploy, from an alarm, or by hand -- not as the
balancer's health check.

Both are unauthenticated: a health check cannot present a token, and neither
route reveals anything an anonymous visitor could not already infer.
