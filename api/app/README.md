# api/app

The FastAPI application itself: configuration, startup wiring, and static
hosting of the compiled UI. No domain logic lives here — that is in
[`pb_client/`](../pb_client), [`pm_client/`](../pm_client) and [`db/`](../db).

## Files

**`config.py`** — a single `Settings` model (pydantic-settings) read from the
environment or the repository-root `.env`. It holds the datastore URLs, the
NCBI base URLs, the download directory, and the HTTP timeout. `get_settings()`
is `lru_cache`d, so settings are read once per process.

`ncbi_contact_email` is unset by default and nothing is sent to NCBI unless you
supply one yourself.

`sciterm_env` is the one runtime switch between local and prod. `local` (the
default) leaves the app exactly as it behaved before auth existed; `prod` gates
the metered routes. One switch rather than a build flag, so the same bundle and
the same image serve both — see [`api/auth`](../auth).

**`Settings` deliberately holds no auth fields.** The signing key and token
policy live in [`api/auth/config.py`](../auth/config.py) as a separate
`AuthSettings`, constructed lazily. Both processes read this module, but only
the API ever constructs `AuthSettings` — so the Celery worker runs with no
`JWT_SECRET` in its environment, and the prod check that refuses to boot
without one constrains the API alone. The worker parses untrusted PubTator
documents; it should not be able to mint admin tokens.

**`health.py`** — `/health` and `/health/ready`, split deliberately.
`/health` is liveness and touches nothing, because it is what a load balancer
polls: if it checked Postgres, a database outage would fail every task at once,
drain the whole target group, and replace the app's error with the balancer's
503. `/health/ready` does check Postgres and the Celery broker and returns 503
naming the failure — for use after a deploy or from an alarm, never as the
balancer's health check. Both report the environment, the build's
`SCITERM_VERSION`, and uptime; a resetting uptime is a crash loop, which is
otherwise easy to mistake for a slow deploy.

**`main.py`** — builds the app. The `lifespan` handler creates one pooled
`httpx.AsyncClient` for the process and constructs the `PubTatorClient` and
`PmcClient` onto `app.state`, closing the client on shutdown. Sharing one pool
across both clients is deliberate: NCBI asks callers to stay under roughly
three requests per second, which is easier to honour from a single pool.

Route order matters here. The `/pb` router is included *before* `StaticFiles`
is mounted at `/`, because a root mount otherwise swallows every path. The
corpus package's `protected_router` is included before its free `router` for
the same reason at a smaller scale: registered after, `/corpus/rag_search`
would be matched by `/corpus/{paper_id}` and rejected as a bad integer.

Chat, annotation, and definition routers are also assembled here. Chat turns
are durable before RAG starts; generated artifacts are persisted by the stream
pipeline, and definitions create their annotation before returning.

`/admin/*` is not gated by `require_user`: those routes authenticate
themselves with an SSH signature rather than a token, so they must stay
reachable without one — see [`api/auth`](../auth).

The SPA catch-all stays open to everyone even in prod. The login gate is a
React modal, so `index.html` and `/assets` must load for an anonymous visitor;
only the JSON routes are gated. When no
built UI bundle is present, `/` returns a 503 explaining how to build it rather
than a bare 404. When `SCITERM_UI_DEV_URL` is set — `scripts/dev.sh` sets it
outside `--prod` — the catch-all 307s to Vite instead, because `ui/dist` is
only rebuilt by `--prod` and would otherwise serve a stale UI.

## Dependencies

`fastapi`, `pydantic-settings`, `httpx`. Imports `api.auth` for the
authentication routers, `api.pb_client` and
`api.pm_client` for the clients and routers, `api.ncbi` to build the one
pooled, rate-limited HTTP client they share, and `api.cache` for the document
cache handed to the PubTator client. It also assembles `api.chats`,
`api.annotations`, and `api.define_term`.

## Configuration

See `.env.example` at the repository root for the recognised variables.
