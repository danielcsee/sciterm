"""Chunk embeddings via a local sentence-transformers model.

The model is loaded lazily and cached per worker process: ~440MB of weights
that must not be re-read per task, but must also not be imported at module
scope, or the FastAPI web process would pay for torch on startup too.

Token counts are always computed from the text with the model's own tokenizer.
Nothing is estimated, and no count is stored — a stored count is one that can
drift from the text it describes.
