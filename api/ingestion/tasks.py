"""The import chain.

    chain(ingest_paper.s(pmid) | embed_paper.s())

Two stages, split where the failure economics differ. `ingest_paper` is bound
by NCBI's ~3 req/s and costs another rate-limited fetch to retry; `embed_paper`
is CPU-bound and free to retry locally. Chunking rides along with ingest
because chunks are 1:1 with PubTator passages — a list comprehension over data
already in hand, which would not earn its own broker hop.

Tasks pass a `paper_id`, never a payload. The fetched document is ~130KB and
the vectors for one paper are larger still; both stay in Postgres and only an
integer crosses the broker.
