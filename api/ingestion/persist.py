"""Write a fetched paper into Postgres.

Split from `tasks.py` so the mapping logic is testable without a broker. Every
function is idempotent: re-importing a paper updates rather than duplicates,

Child rows use replace-semantics — delete this paper's rows, insert the new

benefit. The exception is `paper_entity_mentions`, which is re-pointed rather
