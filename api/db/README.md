# api/db

The Postgres layer: schema, session plumbing, and migrations. Everything here
is populated from one PubTator response per paper.

The schema supports semantic retrieval through `paper_chunks.embedding`
(pgvector) and full-text search through `paper_chunks.text_search`, a stored
generated tsvector with a GIN index, while retaining the source paper's
entities, mentions, relations, and references for analysis. Entity candidate
matching uses canonical-name vectors on `entities` and keeps one vector per
distinct mention surface form in `entity_mention_embeddings`, separate from
source annotations.

## Files

**`base.py`** — `Base`, the lazily-built engine, and `session_scope()`, which
commits on success and rolls back on failure. `normalise_url()` forces the
psycopg3 driver, because a bare `postgresql://` URL makes SQLAlchemy reach for
psycopg2, which is not installed.

**`models.py`** — the tables: `papers`, `paper_pubtator_docs`, `paper_authors`,
`paper_chunks`, `entities`, `paper_entity_mentions`,
`entity_mention_embeddings`, `paper_relations`, `paper_references`,
`paper_stage_runs`.

The access-control tables — `users`, `auth_sessions`, `free_access_codes` —
live in [`api/auth/models.py`](../auth/models.py) instead, because they are
that feature's schema and share nothing with the paper corpus. The entity
group tables live in [`api/groups/models.py`](../groups/models.py) for the
same reason. They use this
`Base` and this migration chain, so `env.py` imports both for their side effect
on `Base.metadata`; forget that import and autogenerate proposes dropping
them.

## Three design rules encoded here

**Store what cannot be recomputed locally.** Authors, references, annotations
and relations come from a rate-limited API, so re-deriving means re-fetching. A
paper-level embedding is deliberately absent — rebuildable from text we hold,
so a migration can add it later for free.

**`pmid` is the natural key, not `pmcid`.** PubTator is keyed on PMID and search
always returns one; `pmcid` is null for roughly a quarter of results, which are
abstract-only. Those still get a row, with `has_full_text = false`.

**Constrain identity, not vocabulary.** Vocabularies NCBI controls
(`section_type`, `entity_type`, `relation_type`) are unconstrained text, so a
new upstream value cannot become an ingest failure. Ones we own (`stage`,
`status`) are constrained. `entities.identifier` is constrained because it *is*
the row's identity — a blank one means nothing, and the suffix is alphanumeric
rather than numeric, MeSH ids being a letter and digits.

Ids are stored namespaced. `MESH:D065627` already is; a bare id is **qualified
with its source database** — `672` becomes `ncbi_gene:672` — because a bare
number is unique only within one NCBI database, and gene 9606 and taxon 9606
would otherwise collide on one row.

`entities.database` is therefore NOT NULL: without it we cannot say what an
identifier means, or qualify a bare one. A concept whose provenance cannot be
established is **rejected individually** — the paper, its chunks and its other
entities still import, and the count is logged. Provenance is taken from what
upstream sent, from a sibling annotation in the same paper, from the entity
type, or from the namespace the id already carries.
