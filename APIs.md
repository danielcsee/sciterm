# Third-party APIs

Every external request this project makes, and what we know about each. All
three services are NCBI's, which rate-limits them as a whole, so they draw on
**one shared budget of ~3 requests/second** enforced in
[`api/ncbi/http.py`](api/ncbi/http.py). The budget is a single Redis key, so it
holds across the web process and every Celery worker, not just within one.

Besides NCBI, only OpenAI is called (see the end of this file). NCBI needs no
API keys, and `NCBI_CONTACT_EMAIL` — if set — is appended to the `User-Agent`
and is the only thing we volunteer about ourselves.

Export responses are cached for 24h by PMID (see [`api/cache`](api/cache)), so a
request listed below may not reach NCBI at all. Full-text documents only, and
only when `full=true`.

## PubTator3

Base: `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3-api`
Client: [`api/pb_client/pubtator.py`](api/pb_client/pubtator.py) → exposed as `/pb/*`

### `GET /search/`

| Param | Notes |
|---|---|
| `text` | Free-text query. Required, non-empty. |
| `page` | 1-based. |

Response: `{current, page_size, count, total_pages, results[]}`. We trust
`current` over what we asked for — requesting page 9e9 returns an empty page
rather than an error.

Each result carries `pmid`, `pmcid`, `title`, `journal`, `authors`, `date`,
`doi`, `score`, `text_hl`. **`page_size` is not a parameter** — upstream always
returns 10 per page, so `search()` reports the size that came back instead of
accepting one.

`text_hl` is marked up as `@GENE_BRCA1 @GENE_672 @@@<m>BRCA1</m>@@@ suppresses`
— concept tags, then the matched span fenced in `@@@` with query terms in `<m>`.
`strip_highlight_markup` removes all of it for display.

### `GET /publications/export/biocjson`

| Param | Notes |
|---|---|
| `pmids` | Comma-separated. **Max 100 per request**; we chunk at that. |
| `full` | `true` for full text; omitted returns title + abstract. |

Returns BioC JSON: passages, annotations, relations, references. Three response
shapes, all handled by `_parse_documents` — a bare object, a `{"PubTator3": […]}`
wrapper, or one JSON document per line, depending on how many ids were asked
for. An **error** comes back as a bare list of strings, e.g.
`["pmids is a mandatory parameter."]`, which a success never is.

Two measured constraints:

- **PMID-keyed, always.** Passing `pmcids=` alone is rejected with HTTP 400.
  This costs nothing: a paper has full text exactly when it is also in PMC, and
  search returns both ids.
- **`full=true` is mandatory if you need `pmcid`.** The light export reports
  `pmcid: null` even for papers that *are* in PMC — the field only appears when
  full text is actually returned. So "does a full paper exist for this PMID?"
  cannot be answered by a cheaper call.

There is no citation graph here: references come from the paper's own
bibliography, and nothing reports who cites *it*.

## PMC Open Access (S3)

Base: `https://pmc-oa-opendata.s3.amazonaws.com`
Client: [`api/pm_client/pmc.py`](api/pm_client/pmc.py) → exposed as `/pm/download`

A plain S3 bucket, not an API: no query interface, no search, keyed on PMCID.
It replaced NCBI's retired OA FTP service in August 2026. PubTator cannot serve
these files, which is why this integration exists at all.

### `GET /metadata/<PMCID>.<version>.json`

Per-article metadata. We try `.1` first — almost every article is version 1 —
and only fall back to a listing when that 404s, so the common case is one
request rather than two.

Fields used: `is_pmc_openaccess` (we refuse to download anything else),
`version`, `pmcid`, `pmid`, `doi`, `title`, `citation`, `license_code`,
`is_retracted`, and the `s3://` locations `xml_url`, `text_url`, `pdf_url`,
`media_urls[]`.

### `GET /?list-type=2&prefix=<PMCID>.&delimiter=/`

S3 ListObjectsV2, the version fallback. Returns **XML**, not JSON, namespaced
`http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/`; we read `CommonPrefixes/Prefix`.

### `GET /<key>`

The files themselves — JATS XML, plain text, PDF, supplementary media. Streamed
to a `.part` file that is renamed on completion, so an interrupted download
cannot be mistaken for a finished one. Fetched serially: one article can carry a
long tail of media files.

## NCBI E-utilities

Base: `https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils`
Client: [`api/eu_client/eutils.py`](api/eu_client/eutils.py) — no HTTP surface

Used for one job: naming concepts PubTator leaves unnamed. It sends
`"name": "9606"` for Species and `"name": "4362"` for CellLine — the identifier
again — because it has no label for those types.

### `GET /esummary.fcgi`

| Param | Notes |
|---|---|
| `db` | `taxonomy` or `gene`. Others are not used. |
| `id` | Comma-separated. Batched; 62 taxon ids is one call. |
| `retmode` | `json`. |

```
db=taxonomy&id=9685,9606
  9685 -> scientificname "Felis catus",  commonname "domestic cat"
  9606 -> scientificname "Homo sapiens", commonname "human"
```

No API key. A retired taxon returns `status: "merged"` with **both** name fields
empty rather than an error, so those concepts keep their fallback label.

Only NCBI ids resolve here: `CVCL:` is Cellosaurus (Expasy) and `OMIM:` needs
an omim.org key. Neither is called.

---

## Not used

**`efetch` / `esearch`.** Noted because they are the obvious things to reach for
alongside `esummary` above: `efetch` on `pubmed` takes PMIDs and returns
abstracts only, `efetch` on `pmc` takes PMCIDs and returns full text. The same
PMID/PMCID split applies there, so they buy us nothing PubTator and the PMC
bucket do not already give.

See [`pmcid vs pmid.txt`](pmcid%20vs%20pmid.txt) for the measurements behind the
id constraints.

## OpenAI

Base: `https://api.openai.com/v1` (the `openai` SDK's default)
Client: [`api/llm/client.py`](api/llm/client.py) → called from `/corpus/rag_search`

### `POST /responses`

One call per chat query, via `client.responses.parse`. Authenticated with
`OPENAI_API_KEY`; unset, the call is skipped and chat runs without routing.

| Param | Value |
|---|---|
| `model` | `OPENAI_MODEL`, default `gpt-5-mini` |
| `instructions` | The routing prompt in `api/llm/intent.py` |
| `input` | JSON: `{query, candidate_entities: [{id, name, type, matched_text}]}` |
| `tools` | `paper_search`, `paper_analysis`, `no_match` — strict schemas from Pydantic |
| `tool_choice` | `required`, with `parallel_tool_calls: false` — exactly one call |
| `reasoning.effort` | `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT`, default `low`; omitted when unset |
| `store` | `false` — nothing is retained for later retrieval |

Response: one `function_call` item whose arguments carry
`entities: [{entity_id, phrase}]` (plus `reason` for `no_match`). Ids that were
not offered as candidates are dropped. Measured at ~3–5s per call with
`gpt-5-mini` at `low` effort. Timeout `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (20s), one retry.
