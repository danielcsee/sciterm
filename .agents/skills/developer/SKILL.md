description: Use whenever writing, modifying, or refactoring code in this project - backend or frontend. Covers directory layout, the per-directory README requirement, and the feature-branch git workflow.

Identify the language you're using and the area you're working on (backend, frontend, or both), and use the skills which best correspond to that. When writing backend code (Python/Celery, PostgreSQL, or Neo4j), use the `backend` skill. When writing frontend code (React/Typescript), use the `frontend` skill.

Before doing any work, use git to check out a new feature branch from the dev branch. Do all your work on that branch, then merge your feature branch back into dev. Always merge your feature branches into dev.

Do not use deprecated functions, libraries, or components. If you detect that library code is deprecated, look up its supported replacement and use that instead.

## Coding Conventions

Put major features into their own directories, and export a public interface when necessary.

Avoid declaring functions inside of other functions. Prefer defining separate helpers instead.

Separate 'interface' code from 'implementation', and define helper functions for implementation. A function with three distinct logical steps that each occupy ~10 lines of code should NOT implement each step inline. instead, it should call three internal helper functions as its implementation.

Before doing work on a file, check the directory for a README and read that first.

Whenever you add a new directory, add a README to that directory summarizing what the feature does, what dependencies it relies on, and what its subdirectories are for. Keep the README under 250 words and update it whenever you make changes to its directory.

## APIs

Create a separate directory and separate api client for every api you integrate with. Whenever you make a change to how you call a third-party api, update APIs.md in project root.
